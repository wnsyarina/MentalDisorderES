Mental Disorder Diagnosis Expert System 

Steps on how to open the file:
1. Download XAMPP from ApacheFriends (if you don't have it installed. I suggest check first because mine memang dah ada even tak pernah download)
2. Place the project folder (in this case, it is the whole project file) in htdocs folder under /xampp in your computer's directory

3. Open XAMPP control panel and press 'Start' for Apache
4. Open the project folder in VSCode and select the index file
5. Load the system in your browser using 'http://localhost/mentaldisorderES/index.php'

What you need to edit:
1. The questions in question.php file. Edit the questions and follow the numbering order based on google docs.
   Example: Syarina 1-5, Aisyah 6-10,...and so on.
2. Edit the Category under the questions in the same question.php file.
3. Go to results.php and update the disorder information based on ICD-10.
4. Edit or add anything to make the website better if you have any ideas to improve it. <3
